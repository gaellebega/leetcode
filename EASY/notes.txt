 Big O is a way to measure how fast a code or algorithm grow as size of input gets bigger to measure we count the operations

 why it matters?
 to know the time complexity how many steps your codes needs
 space complexity how much estra memory it uses

 1. O(1) constant time
 return arr[0]
 2.O(n) linear time
 for the single for loop
 3.O(npow2) Quadratic time
 for nested loop
 4.O(logn) logarithimic
 5.O(2pown) exponential
 very slow brute force recrusion
 6.O(n!) factorial
 used in persmutation extreme and slow
