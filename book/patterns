-you can check if somthing exist in 0(1) time super fast
-you can store into and retiecve data it quicky using the keys

let us say you have the box contain many colors of the candies so to separate them you will need to pur the candies down so to solve the problem you are going to use the hasmaps which will contain the box of each color
you can use them to:

-count  the characters
-comparing the arrays
-sliding the windo memory
storing the last seen index
