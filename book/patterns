1.Hashmaps

the hasmaps is datastructure that store key->values pairs it is like the dictionary to search for the word you dont have to read the whole the dictionary but straight to the word.
-you can check if somthing exist in 0(1) time super fast
-you can store into and retiecve data it quicky using the keys

let us say you have the box contain many colors of the candies so to separate them you will need to pur the candies down so to solve the problem you are going to use the hasmaps which will contain the box of each color
you can use them to:
-find the duplicates
-count  the characters
-comparing the arrays
-sliding the windo memory
storing the last seen index


2.Two pointers 

we use 2 pointers is used when the soilution requires comparing or processing two positions in a linear structure like an arrays or strings at the same time.

how they work one at start one at the end orboth at the start but move at different speeds
they move depending on the condition until they meet

when do we use them
.the array is sorted
.you need to find pairs that satisfy some rules(sum,difference,matching etc)
.you need to reverse or compare the characters
.you need to merge 2 sorted arrays
.you need fast movement from both ends without nested loops

N.B: two pointers eliminates the need of a nested loop
O(n^2) they move bointers at once O(n)
